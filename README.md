#refactor later

I added tailwindCSS but it's not compatible with the official documentation in tailwindCSS. In Next JS doc it's suggest to use their github code.

so i added _app.js then import the style from there and it works, idk if it will cause some issues. Good luck

The default export of _app.js is a top-level React component that wraps all the pages in your application. You can use this component to keep state when navigating between pages, or to add global styles as we're doing here. Learn more about _app.js file.

next/image optimization make my browser & terminal crash so I'll add it later

now do the desktop.

I kinda figure out the layout now I just need to design some components.

I guess it will be done in 3 days.

the main feature components is mostly done, i need to add footer - social links etc
